# MyEvidence
For clinicians who love Pubmed, but hate having 37 tabs open and trying to track what they've read... who love guidelines, but can't read through 80-page PDFs to find the parts relevant to them.

## What you can do
- Save PubMed abstracts by PMID. The app auto-extracts key details.
- Upload guideline PDFs. The app extracts recommendations and organizes them into categories
- Search and browse your database.
- Search Pubmed in an intuitive way, and a ledger helps you track what you are caught up on
- Use your database to ask AI focused questions without dilution from the whole internet. 

## Pages
- **Pubmed --> Abstract**: Enter a PMID and click fetch. PICO information is extracted and normalized from the abstract. Number of patients, author's conclusion, and specialty is also extracted. You can change anything in free-text at this time, but if you want to edit later, you have to delete the abstract from the database and re-fetch it. Make sure to add the abstract to your database if you want.
- **Guidelines (PDF Upload)**: Upload a PDF from your computer (Guidelines are usually free). Title, year, and specialty are extracted. Recommendations are extracted and sorted into pre-specified categories. Repeats are searched for and placed at the end. You can edit the resulting display but this is risky if you change the formatting. You can do more in the DB Search page. 
- **DB Search**: Search for previously added abstracts and guidelines, which are displayed in a normalized and clean way. For guidelines, specific recommendations can be deleted from here as well.
- **DB Browse**: Browse by year or specialty. Title, journal, number of patients, and author's conclusion are easily visible.
- **Generate meta**: Select an evidence base and then ask AI a focused question. You can add evidence to folders so for future questions, selecting an evidence base can be quicker. 
- **Search Pubmed**: Choose a year, month, journal, and study type, and see all results. You don't search specific topics here. Journal and study types are also intentionally limited for now. You only see the title on search results. Decide from the title whether you want to not see it again on future searches (do this if the paper is irrelevant to you), or load it in the PMID --> Abstract page. When all the articles from a particular search are cleared, this gets documented in your ledger so you don't have to make that search again. 
- **Delete**: Delete guidelines or abstracts if you want to. You may want to delete an abstract just so you can re-fetch it and edit it.
- **About**: This page
- **History**: In case you want to know when you fetched or uploaded something. 

## Please note, the online version is a preview
- Changes are not permanent and glitches are possible! But if you like the app or have any suggestions, I would love to hear about it! Thanks for checking it out! - Arjun
