# MyEvidence
For clinicians who love Pubmed, but hate having 37 tabs open and trying to track what they've read... who love guidelines, but can't read through 80-page PDFs to find the parts relevant to them.

## What you can do
- Save PubMed abstracts by PMID. The app auto-extracts key details.
- Upload guideline PDFs. The app extracts recommendations and organizes them into categories.
- Search and browse your database.
- Search PubMed and track your progress with a ledger.
- Use your database to ask AI focused questions without dilution from the whole internet.

## Pages
- **PMID → Abstract**: Enter a PMID and click fetch. PICO information is extracted and normalized from the abstract. Number of patients, author's conclusion, and specialty are also extracted. You can change anything in free-text at this time, but if you want to edit later, you have to delete the abstract from the database and re-fetch it.
- **Guidelines (PDF Upload)**: Upload a PDF from your computer (guidelines are usually free). Title, year, and specialty are extracted. Recommendations are extracted and sorted into pre-specified categories. Possible repeats are placed at the end. You can edit the resulting display, but this is risky because you can accidentally change formatting.
- **Browse studies**: Browse by year or specialty. Title, journal, number of patients, and author's conclusion are easily visible. Includes a search bar.
- **Single-study view**: View one selected record in detail. Also includes a search bar. 
- **Generate meta**: Select an evidence base and then ask AI a focused question. You can also add evidence to folders. This makes selecting larger evidence bases quicker.
- **Search PubMed**: Choose a year, month, specialty, and journal, and see all results (no topic search). Journals and study types are intentionally limited to high impact and high level of evidence, respectively. As you search, decide whether the paper is irrelevant to you (click "Don't show again"), or load it in the PMID → Abstract page and save it. The ledger tracks progress over time.
- **Delete**: Delete guidelines or abstracts if you want to. You may want to delete an abstract just so you can re-fetch it and edit it.
- **About**: This page.
- **History**: In case you want to know when you fetched or uploaded something.

## Please note, the online version is a preview
- Changes are not permanent and glitches are possible! But if you like the app or have any suggestions, I would love to hear about it! Thanks for checking it out! - Arjun
